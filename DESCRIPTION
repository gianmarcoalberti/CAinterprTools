Description: A number of interesting packages are available to perform
    Correspondence Analysis in R. At the best of my knowledge, they lack
    tools to help users to 'eyeball' aspects that are crucial to the interpretation of the CA results (e.g., contribution
    of rows/cols categories to the principal axes, quality of the display,
    correlation of rows/cols categories with dimensions, etc). Besides
    providing those facilities, this package allows to calculate the
    significance of the CA dimensions by means of the 'Average Rule', the
    Malinvaud test, and by permutation tests. It also allows to
    calculate the permuted significance of the CA total intertia.
